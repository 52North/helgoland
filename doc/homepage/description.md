# Description

Helgoland is a very lightweight web application to explore, analyze and visualize sensor web data. It is based just on HTML, JavaScript and CSS. You can:

- explore stations or mobile sensor platforms in a map
- select time series by a list selection
- visualize time series data
- create favorites of selected time series

The application can be connected to different Sensor Web endpoints (REST-APIs). These Sensor Web REST-APIs provides a thin access layer to sensor data via RESTful Web binding with different output formats.

The following main frameworks are used to provide this application:

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) 
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) 
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [momentJs](http://momentjs.com/)
- [flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/)
